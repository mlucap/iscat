# Overview
Really just meant for my personal discord with friends and not other servers. If you want to host it yourself follow the next header.

# Installation
First, clone the repo to a desired location
Next, be sure you have all the requirements
- `$ pip3 install requirements.txt`

After that, either create an evironment varible on your computer/ on your hosting service named `BOT_TOKEN` with your bot's token and run the `main.py` file
